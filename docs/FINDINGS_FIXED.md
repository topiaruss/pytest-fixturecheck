# pytest-fixturecheck Fixed Strict Parameter Behavior

## Issue Summary

We discovered that in pytest-fixturecheck 0.3.2, the `strict` parameter mentioned in some documentation had no actual effect in the implementation. All property validation would always raise exceptions when property values didn't match expected values, regardless of whether `strict=False` was specified.

## Investigation

Our investigation found that:

1. The `property_values_validator` function in `validators_fix.py` included the `strict` parameter in the expected values dictionary instead of using it to control validation behavior.

2. The `strict` parameter was effectively ignored, and all property validation would always fail tests when validation failed.

3. There was no warning mechanism implemented for non-strict validation.

## Fix Implementation

We implemented the following changes to fix the issue:

1. Modified `property_values_validator` in `validators_fix.py` to:
   - Extract the `strict` parameter from the expected values dictionary
   - Default to `strict=True` when not specified
   - Issue warnings instead of raising exceptions when `strict=False`

2. Fixed the `with_property_values` function in `validators_fix.py` to:
   - Properly handle validation during both fixture setup and direct function calls
   - Maintain backward compatibility by preserving the `_fixturecheck` markers
   - Support both pytest's fixture validation and manual validation for tests

3. Updated the `with_property_values` function in `decorator.py` to correctly use the fixed `check_property_values` function.

4. Added comprehensive tests to verify the behavior of both strict and non-strict validation:
   - `tests/test_strict_parameter.py` tests the core behavior of validators
   - `tests/test_strict_parameter_fixtures.py` tests real-world usage with fixtures

## Current Behavior

With these fixes, the `strict` parameter now works as expected:

1. **strict=True (default)**: Raises exceptions when property values don't match expected values
   ```python
   @pytest.fixture
   @with_property_values(name="test", value=42)
   def fixture():
       return TestObject("wrong", 99)  # This will raise an exception
   ```

2. **strict=False**: Issues warnings when property values don't match expected values
   ```python
   @pytest.fixture
   @with_property_values(strict=False, name="test", value=42)
   def fixture():
       return TestObject("wrong", 99)  # This will issue warnings but not fail tests
   ```

## Testing

We have created two test files to verify this behavior:

1. `tests/test_strict_parameter.py` - Tests the core behavior of the `strict` parameter
2. `tests/test_strict_parameter_fixtures.py` - Tests real-world usage with pytest fixtures

The tests confirm that the parameter works correctly with both the `check_property_values` function and the `with_property_values` decorator. All tests in the existing codebase continue to pass, ensuring we haven't broken any existing functionality.

## Documentation Updates

We've updated the documentation to correctly reflect the implementation:

1. Added explanations about the `strict` parameter to function docstrings
2. Added examples of non-strict validation
3. Created test files that serve as examples of how to use the feature
4. Created this document to explain the issue and solution

## Conclusion

The `strict` parameter in pytest-fixturecheck now works as expected, allowing users to choose between strict validation (raising exceptions) and non-strict validation (issuing warnings) when checking property values in fixtures.

This improvement makes pytest-fixturecheck more flexible and user-friendly, particularly for cases where validation failures should not prevent tests from running but should still be flagged. This enables teams to gradually improve their test fixtures while maintaining visibility of issues.
